# Why-is-AI-feeling-lacking-foundaiton(English was desgined to have this kind of 10000 interpeations in one sentence.)

- I can say: why is AI not constructing these on its own

- some may say: why do I feel AI lacks foundations


Using natural language processing (NLP) languages or conventional languages like English, Chinese, and Japanese as computing languages are two distinct paradigms with unique implications. Here are the comparisons and some alternative ideas:

---

### **NLP Languages as Computing Languages**
- **Definition:** NLP languages refer to machine-readable and structured constructs designed for AI or computational interpretation, e.g., Prolog, SQL, LISP.
- **Pros:**
  - Optimized for specific computational tasks (e.g., logic programming, database management).
  - Clear syntax, often designed for unambiguous interpretation.
  - Direct integration with AI systems for inferencing and symbolic processing.
- **Cons:**
  - Limited human accessibility without proper training.
  - Specialized, not suitable for natural language-based expressions.

### **Human Languages (English, Chinese, Japanese) as Computing Languages**
- **Definition:** Utilizing human natural languages for programming and computational logic.
- **Pros:**
  - Increases accessibility to programming for non-technical individuals.
  - Promotes inclusivity by allowing people to code in their native language.
  - Simplifies computational problem formulation in natural terms.
- **Cons:**
  - Ambiguity in natural language poses challenges for accurate computational interpretation.
  - Requires extensive preprocessing to standardize syntax and semantics.
  - Complex grammatical structures in some languages (e.g., Chinese or Japanese) can increase computational overhead.

### **Alternative Ideas**
1. **Hybrid Natural-Formal Languages:**
   - A mix of human and machine-readable syntax, e.g., "English-like pseudocode."
   - Example: *"If today is Monday, then output 'Hello, World!'"*

2. **Domain-Specific Natural Language:**
   - Developing domain-specific interpretable human language syntax.
   - Example: Medical computing using *"Calculate dosage for Patient-A based on weight and condition."*

3. **Universal Semantic Language (USL):**
   - A universal programming paradigm that uses semantic units universally recognizable by both humans and machines.
   - Example: Symbols for common tasks across languages, such as ⨁ for addition.

4. **AI-Powered Conversational Code:**
   - Voice or text-based programming using natural language dialogues.
   - Example: "Create a Python script to sort this list alphabetically."

5. **Visual-NLP Integration:**
   - Combining diagrams and natural language annotations for code generation.
   - Example: Flowcharts linked to English sentences, auto-compiling to executable code.

### **A Few Promising Languages**
- **English-Like Computing:**
  - Example: COBOL-style syntax (*"ADD 1 TO TOTAL GIVING RESULT."*)
- **NLP-Based Languages:**
  - Prolog, LISP (logic-based and expressive).
- **Chinese Computing Constructs:**
  - Machine interpretable syntax leveraging Chinese character brevity.
  - Example: 编程语言 (Programming language) could map to compact functional blocks.
- **Japanese-Style Constructs:**
  - Katakana/Hiragana-based commands, utilizing phonetic simplicity.
  - Example: *計算する* (to calculate) as a computational command.

If this resonates, I can expand on specific use cases or propose formal grammars for a new computing paradigm!
